            <p>Many people often struggle with being somewhere with no outlets and 
                suddenly realizing that they are low on battery, so a lot of them 
                tend to bring a portable charger with them. This is done to ensure 
                they have enough battery on their phone for the entire day, but a 
                major issue that is common for portable chargers is finding efficient
                and trustworthy ones to buy especially with so many available to buy.</p>
